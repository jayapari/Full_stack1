          <p>A blog is a website or page that is a part of a larger website. Typically, it features articles written in a conversational style with accompanying pictures or videos.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Blogging is a fun and flexible way for self-expression and social connection, so it is no wonder blogs have become very popular. In addition, people can start blogging to improve their writing skills or even promote their businesses.</p>
          <div class="box"><p> A professional blogger can even make money from blogging in various ways, such as Google ads and Amazon affiliate links. Profitable blogs can be of any topic. Think of any subject, and there is probably already a successful blog about it.</p></div>
          <br><br><h2>Heading</h2>
          <p>Created by businesswoman Sophia Amoruso, Girlboss is a community-driven website that aims to help women redefine their success. Its primary target audience is ambitious women who want to advice rapidly in their careers, build networks, and self-improve.

            The Girlboss lifestyle blog provides various blog topics such as beauty, wellness, work, and finance.</p>
            <br><br><h3>Sub-heading</h3>
          <p>The Girlboss team makes sure the pictures accompanying their articles follow the same color scheme.<hr>
          </p>  
          <p>All the pictures feature subjects set in front of a colorful background mix of soft, pastel colors. This way, all the photos come together as a visually-attractive and cohesive unit.</p>
          <br><br><h3>Sub-heading</h3>
            <p>The first thing visitors see when visiting the blog is a high-quality, full-screen picture accompanying the title of its latest article. It gives the blog a spotless and pleasing look.

                In addition to the site’s clean layout, the blog includes helpful sliders to go with the outfit ideas.
                
                The sliders feature the blogger’s outfit in the pictures. Clicking on a piece of clothing will lead to an online shop where you can purchase the item in question.
