            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports
            <br>
            Adventure is a thrilling experience which increases the excitement and the rush of adrenaline in the blood. It also refers to an activity that is exciting, exhilarating and having some element of risk. Mountain bike riding, Para gliding, swimming, parachute jumping, and dirt racing are some of the examples of adventurous activities. Adventure is often pursued for psychological improvement and also to gain knowledge and experiences as in case of exploration and jungle safaris. Adventure involves risk yet people long for it because of the boost it gives to one’s confidence and mood. It is surely good to be adventurous unless it is done after carefully analyzing the risk involved.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                 <br><br>
                 The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.

                <h2 class="desc">Para Gliding</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                 <br><br>
                 Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.
